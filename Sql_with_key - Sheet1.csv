2. Zero sales outlets,

"SELECT 
    ep.Name AS CustomerName
FROM 
    external_parties ep where code not in (select CustomerCode from sales_flat);",
    
"
Key factors:
- When generating SQL queries, if you refer to columns using a table alias (e.g., sf.column_name), always define that alias by including the full table name followed by a meaningful short alias (e.g., sales_flat AS sf). The alias should be a logical abbreviation of the table name for clarity and consistency.
- If the user doesn't mention any time period, do not use a time filter in the SQL query.

Tables:
- sales_flat(Date, InvoiceNo, ProductCode, ProductName, Qty, Discount, in_sales, Brand, CustomerCategory, ProductCategory, Route, RepId, RepCode, RepName, CustomerCode, CustomerName,ASM, RSM, Distributor, Type(sales,return))
- sales_hierarchy_nodes(Id, Code, Name) - (This is Rep table)
- planned_routes(PlannedDate, RouteId, RepId)
- sales_targets(Type, Value, Qty, ProductId, StartDate, EndDate)
- route_customer_assignments(RouteId, CustomerID)
- Products(Id, Code, Name, PackSize)
- external_parties(Id, Code, Name,CreatedDate) is this customer table. CreatedDate is added when new customer is created.

Table Relationships:
- sales_targets.RepId = sales_Hierarchy_Nodes.Id
- sales_Flat.RepId = sales_Hierarchy_Nodes.Id
- sales_Flat.ProductCode = products.Code
- sales_Flat.CustomerCode = external_parties.Code"

3. Rep wise top 10 best performance outlet,

"

"
Key factors:
- Sales = Net Sales calculated as select sum(case when fv.Type = 'sales' then (fv.in_sales) else -fv.in_sales end) from Sales_Flat fv;
- When generating SQL queries, if you refer to columns using a table alias (e.g., sf.column_name), always define that alias by including the full table name followed by a meaningful short alias (e.g., sales_flat AS sf). The alias should be a logical abbreviation of the table name for clarity and consistency.
- In the sales_hierarchy_nodes table, the Type field indicates the level of the sales target. When Type = 0, it refers to a primary target, which is the sales target assigned to the distributor. When Type = 1, it refers to a secondary target, which is the target allocated to the sales representative (rep).
- If the user doesn't mention any time period, do not use a time filter in the SQL query.
- In Sales_Flat table, CustomerName = Outlet Name
- Aggregated metrics must be separately grouped by Rep before josining with Rep-level information.
- Joins between differently grouped data must happen only after summarizing to the same granularity level (Rep level).
- Sales and Targets must be calculated separately and only joined after aggregation is complete.
- Avoid causing row duplication due to joins between differently grouped datasets.

Tables:
- sales_flat(Date, InvoiceNo, ProductCode, ProductName, Qty, Discount, in_sales, Brand, CustomerCategory, ProductCategory, Route, RepId, RepCode, RepName, CustomerCode, CustomerName,ASM, RSM, Distributor, Type(sales,return))
